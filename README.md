Let's see if I can get git working.

Instructions:

0. Modify the blacklist to your own liking, just remember to separate each entity with a comma. Write the banned phrases in quotations. Like this: ["Banned word 1", "Banned Word 2", "..."]
0. a. OOPS! This script is super aggressive, so just putting H in would remove every single comment containing a h.
1. Make sure you're logged in to your browser, and that you're allowed to delete comments. This can be any comment section that you're administrating.
2. Press F12, and paste this code into the browser's console.
3. You will get prompted with a warning. Just confirm, and watch the spam disappear. (Not fully automated yet, has to be run manually)
--If you end up at a link similar to https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/undefined, then you're either not logged in, or you lack the permission to remove comments.
